Program should be able to do following:
- play blackjack against itself (OK)
- determine, what is the best choice (Hit, Stay, Double or Split) to each scenario (ONGOING)
- count cards (in an easy way) to improve odds (FUTURE)

Diary:
16.2.   Blackjack uploaded to Github. Most of the code works, but running
        the entire program is not simple.
